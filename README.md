# flowSim

Welcome to the flowSim github repository! flowSim is an R package designed to identify and remove redundant information in bivariate flow cytometry data, increasing the performance of ML algorithms by reducing overfitting while at the same time decreasing computational time for training.

This project is licensed under the terms of the GPL license.

Update (14th September 2023)

The flowSim algorithm and its applications in the machine learning field are described in a manuscript published in the Cytometry Part A journal: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37530476/
